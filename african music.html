                The music you study for your GCSE is most likely to be from sub-Saharan Africa where music is an important part of traditional life.
                African drums
                African drums
                African music is:
                part of everyday activities - everyone joins in clapping, singing and dancing to the music
                part of rites and ceremonies where it is performed by specialist master drummers and court musicians
                not normally written down but passed on through oral tradition
                The influence of black African music is widespread. It came over to America with the African slaves and combined with the folk music of the European settlers to produce new styles of music such as blues, gospel and jazz. These went on to form the basis of pop music today.
                The music played by drum ensembles is very complex in rhythm and texture. The master drummer has the most elaborate part, leading the drum ensemble and playing solos. He leads the drummers by giving them musical cues in the form of rhythm patterns. He also gives cues to dancers to signal changes of tempo or steps.

                West African drumming often uses a timeline.
                A timeline is a short repeated rhythm which is often played by a single or double bell, eg the gonkogui, a double bell with a high note and a low note. The function of the timeline is to hold the piece together.
                Listen to the clip Ashanti Ntumpani as recorded by Mustapha Tettey Addy. Note the cross-rhythms produced by the talking drum and timeline.

                One of the best-known African drums is the West African djembe (pronounced zhem-bay). It is shaped like a large goblet and played with bare hands. The body is carved from a hollowed trunk and is covered in goat skin.
                Talking drums imitate the rhythms and intonations of speech.
                They are double-headed and belong to the family of hourglass-shaped pressure drums. They are played with a beater. The drums can be used to imitate speech patterns or as signals to make announcements or warnings. The pitch of the note is changed by squeezing or releasing the drum's strings with the arm.

                The music played by drum ensembles is very complex in rhythm and texture. The master drummer has the most elaborate part, leading the drum ensemble and playing solos. He leads the drummers by giving them musical cues in the form of rhythm patterns. He also gives cues to dancers to signal changes of tempo or steps.
                In drum ensembles:
                several different rhythms are played at the same time
                the rhythm patterns interlock and overlap to form polyrhythmic patterns and exciting cross-rhythms
                Listen to the pattern formed by the interlocking rhythms of the large talking drum, small talking drum and djembe in the piece "Yiri" as recorded by Koko.
                A cross-rhythm is the effect produced when two conflicting rhythms are heard together.
                Polyrhythm is when two or more rhythms with different pulses are heard together, eg where one drum is playing in triple time and another is playing in quadruple time, three against four.

                Songs include accompanied and unaccompanied solos, duets and choruses. Unaccompanied choruses are an example of a cappella singing. Songs are usually either strophic (split up into verses) or are in call-and-response form.
                In call-and-response form the leader sings a line (the call) and is answered by a chorus (the response). The chorus usually stays the same while the soloist improvises. There is often overlapping between the leader and the chorus. The chorus part is usually homophonic (in block chords).
                Listen to the call and response used in The Star and the Wiseman sung by Ladysmith Black Mambazo - an a cappella Zulu male voice choir from South Africa. Listen for the homophonic response parts.
                African singing often includes glissandos (slides which are sometimes known as portamento) and slurs, whistles, yodels and swoops and types of sound such as a raspy or buzzy quality.
                Melodies are usually organised within a scale of four, five, six, or seven notes. They tend to use small melodic intervals (lots of 2nds and 3rds) and often use recurring patterns and descending phrases.
                Listen to the melodic lines used in Yiri recorded by Koko. Notice the descending phrases based on a four-note scale.
