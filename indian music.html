                Indian musicians learn to play raga (patterns of notes) by imitating and memorising. The music is passed on from teacher to student by oral tradition. Students belong to an extended family of musicians learning from a particular master. This is known as the master-student tradition.
                Most Indian classical music is based on a combination of rag (melodic form), tal (rhythmic form) and drone (sustained note).

                Ragas are patterns of notes but are different to a Western scale or melody. They are really a combination of both. Each rag:
                has a particular ascending and descending pattern
                is associated with a different time of the day, season, mood or special occasion
                Rag Desh is a late evening rag associated with the monsoon season. In Indian music a system known as sargam is used for naming the notes: Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa. The tonic, or ground note, is Sa (this is heard in the drone). Two other important notes in Rag Desh are Pa and Re.

                The tal is a repeating rhythm pattern usually played by the tabla (small drums). It usually has between six and sixteen beats. The beats are grouped into small sections within the pattern. The first beat of the cycle is known as sam. It marks the beginnings and ends of improvisations so it is often accented.
                Tintal is the most common tal. It has the following characteristics:
                sixteen beats (4 + 4 + 4 + 4)
                four sections beginning on the 1st, 5th, 9th and 13th beats
                A drone is a note held (or repeated) throughout a passage of music. It is the sound usually heard first, stating the tonic note, Sa.
                The drone is now often played by an electronic box, but is more traditionally played on a tanpura.
                It is provided by a tanpura playing the notes Sa and Pa which in this case correspond to the notes D and A.
                It is common to mark tala by hand claps and waves. In tintal the beginning of the first, second and fourth sections is marked by a clap, but the beginning of the third section is weaker and this is shown by a wave of the hand.
