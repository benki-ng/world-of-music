                The Caribbean islands lie in a chain from the Bahamas in the north to Trinidad and Tobago in the south. Central in the chain are the largest islands of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Most of the Caribbean population are descendants of West African slaves and settlers from Europe, India and China. The music of the Caribbean differs from island to island, but each kind has its origins in a mixture of African and European influences.

                There are similarities in the types of instruments used across the Caribbean islands. The most popular instruments are percussion and drums, different types of guitar and homemade instruments.

                There are many types of drums, including congas (a pair of tall, narrow, single-headed drums played with the hands) and their smaller version bongos.
                Percussion instruments include:
                claves - two short pieces of wood
                maracas - hand-held shakers
                cabasa - loops of steel balls wrapped round a cylinder, hand-held
                reco-reco or guiro - scrapers
                tragogo - double-headed bells
                These types of instruments are often known as Latin percussion.
                Guitars
                The guitar is found in a number of sizes including the:
                guitarrone (a large four-stringed bass guitar)
                tres (a small guitar with three sets of double strings)
                cuatro (a small guitar with four strings)
